    "C) Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks may include understanding natural language, recognizing images, making decisions, and solving complex problems. AI can be implemented through various techniques, such as machine learning, expert systems, natural language processing, and computer vision.\n",

    "<) Machine Learning:\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves the use of statistical techniques to analyze and interpret patterns in data, allowing machines to learn from examples and improve their performance over time. Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, among others.\n",

The validation set helps to prevent overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized in the training data but fails to generalize to new data. By evaluating the model's performance on the validation set, adjustments can be made to the model's parameters, such as learning rate or regularization, to improve its generalization ability.\n",

It helps in estimating how well the model will perform when deployed in a real-world scenario. The test set provides a final evaluation of the model's accuracy, precision, recall, or other performance metrics.\n",
